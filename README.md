# ttyms — Terminal Microsoft Teams Client

A secure, fast terminal UI client for Microsoft Teams messaging, built in Rust with [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/).

> **⚠️ Here be dragons!** ttyms is in alpha — part experiment, part playground, part "what if Teams lived in a terminal?" fever dream. Things may break, features may vanish, and your terminal might judge your meeting schedule. Use at your own risk (and enjoyment). 🐉

> **📋 Legal fine print:** This is a personal side project with zero affiliation to Microsoft. No Microsoft engineers were harmed in the making of this tool. All trademarks belong to their respective owners — I just really like terminals. ⚖️

## Features

## Prerequisites

- **Microsoft 365 account** with Teams access (work or school account required — personal Microsoft accounts are not supported by the Teams Graph API)

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```sh
brew install davidkaya/tap/ttyms
```

### Cargo (all platforms)

```sh
cargo install ttyms
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```sh
# Using an AUR helper (e.g., yay, paru)
yay -S ttyms      # stable release from crates.io
yay -S ttyms-git  # latest from git
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/davidkaya/ttyms.git
cd ttyms
cargo build --release
# Binary at target/release/ttyms
```

## Setup

ttyms ships with a default Azure AD client ID, so it works out of the box — no app registration required.

Just run it:

```sh
ttyms
```

On first run, you'll be prompted to sign in using the device code flow.

### Configuration (optional)

A config file is created on first run at:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\ttyms\config.toml`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/ttyms/config.toml`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/ttyms/config.toml`

You can override the default client ID with your own Azure AD app registration:

```toml
client_id = "your-application-client-id-here"
tenant_id = "common"
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Registering your own Azure AD Application</strong></summary>

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) → **Microsoft Entra ID** → **App registrations**
2. Click **New registration**
3. Set:
   - **Name**: `ttyms` (or any name)
   - **Supported account types**: *Accounts in any organizational directory* (multi-tenant; personal Microsoft accounts are not supported by Teams Graph API)
   - **Redirect URI**: leave blank
4. Click **Register**
5. Go to **Authentication**:
   - Enable **Allow public client flows** → Save
   - Click **Add a platform** → **Mobile and desktop applications**
   - Under custom redirect URIs, add: `http://localhost` → Save
6. Go to **API permissions** → **Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**:
   - `User.Read`
   - `User.ReadBasic.All`
   - `Chat.ReadWrite`
   - `ChatMessage.Read`
   - `ChatMessage.Send`
   - `Presence.Read`
   - `Presence.ReadWrite`
   - `Team.ReadBasic.All`
   - `Channel.ReadBasic.All`
   - `ChannelMessage.Read.All`
   - `ChannelMessage.Send`
   - `offline_access`
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and set it in your `config.toml`

</details>

### Authentication Options

**Device Code Flow (default)** — displays a code, you sign in via browser:
```sh
cargo run
```

**PKCE Browser Flow** — browser opens automatically, redirects to localhost:
```sh
cargo run -- --pkce
```

## Troubleshooting Logs

ttyms writes troubleshooting logs to a per-user file and only logs predefined event labels (no message text, user identifiers, tokens, URLs, or other PII). Coverage includes startup/auth, Graph request outcomes, async refresh/presence flows, file sharing, and image preview queue/download/decode stages.

- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ttyms\logs\ttyms.log`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/ttyms/ttyms.log`
- **Linux**: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/ttyms/logs/ttyms.log` (fallback: `~/.local/state/ttyms/logs/ttyms.log`)

## Security

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Token storage | OS credential manager via [`keyring`](https://crates.io/crates/keyring) crate |
| Memory safety | Tokens zeroized on drop via [`zeroize`](https://crates.io/crates/zeroize) crate |
| Auth flow | OAuth2 Device Code Flow (public client, no client secret stored) |
| Transport | All API calls over HTTPS to Microsoft Graph |
| Scopes | Minimal permissions per feature, all delegated (user context only) |
| Logout | `--logout` securely removes credentials from OS store |
| Read receipts | Chats automatically marked as read when viewed |
